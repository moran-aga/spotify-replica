  "lyrics": "=I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind\nLearned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world's against me is when I really come alive\nAnd everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become\nI guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or an uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nShow me the locked doors, I find another use for the key\nAnd you'll see\nI'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\nAge twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me\nWith my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou'\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now\nSomehow\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nOh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser\nWelcome to the new show\nI guess you know I've been away\nBut where I'm heading, who knows\nBut my heart will stay the same\nWelcome to the new show\nI guess you know I've been away\nBut where I'm heading, who knows\nMy pain, eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser"

Should I?\nMaybe I'll get drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nTo feel a little love\nI wanna hold your heart in both hands\nNot watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can\nAnd I've got no plans for the weekend\nSo should we speak then?\nKeep it between friends?\nThough I know you'll never love me like you used to\nThere may be other people like us\nWho see the flicker of a clipper when they light up\nFlames just create us\nBurns don't heal like before\nAnd you don't hold me anymore\nOn cold days cold plays out like the band's name\nI know I can't heal things with a handshake\nYou know I can change,\nAs I began saying\nYou cut me wide open like landscape\nOpen bottles of beer but never champagne\nTo applaud you with the sound that my hands make\nShould I? Should I?\nMaybe I'll get drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nTo feel a little love\nAll by myself\nI'm here again\nAll by myself\nYou know I'll never change\nAll by myself\nAll by myself\nI'm just drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nTo feel a little love"
